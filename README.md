# Inspector

https://inspector.pypi.io provides a mechanism for security researchers to
quickly share specific contents of a project hosted on PyPI when submitting
security reports.

Inspector is not currently supported for any other purpose.


## Develop

You can use any old way to install & run `inspector` locally.

We support `docker compose` via `make serve`.

You may also launch a Gitpod Workspace, which should set up most things for you:
